            I believe that aesthetics has purposes of it's own, more than being a by-product of function. It creates
            the first impressions of beauty & delight,
            drives curiosity and tells our gut reactions whether to try out or abandon a product or not. It
            differentiates the product by giving character inside it's breed.
            It can be a way to solve for people of different tastes. Imagine how boring and monotonous would be the
            world around us, if everything was designed purely on functional objectives. <br><br>

            <b>All these holds true in the digital world too, where we tend to classify UX and UI as discrete entities. 
              <b>Can a design be good, without these working in harmony?</b></b>
